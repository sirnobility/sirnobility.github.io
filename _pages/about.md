###### Colossians 3:23 - Salem, OR  


Hello there. 

I'm a college student that's interested in probably too many things for my own good. I thoroughly enjoy learning and am curious about pretty much everything. Special emphasis on Physics/Engineering & Theology (Which are more closely related than you may think).  

I created this website in an attempt to keep my thoughts organized as I write about topics I'm interested in. My philosophy being that if I research a topic well enough to present it in "blog" form, I will have reached a certain level of understanding of the topic.  

I suspect as time goes on my thoughts & ideas will evolve and I'll update my posts accordingly.  

Special shout out to Jesus for creating the Universe (John 1:3), and for giving humanity the ultimate gift. Salvation (John 3:16).
