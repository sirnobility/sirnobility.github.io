Hello there. 

I'm a college student that's interested in probably too many things for my own good; especially Physics/Engineering & Theology.
(Which are more closely related than you may think)

I thoroughly enjoy learning and am curious about pretty much everything. I launched this website in an attempt to keep my thoughts organized as I write about topics I'm interested in, and as a fun little summer project to learn web development better, and get accustomed to coding in preparation for my Computer Science classes this upcoming year woohoo!
