description: Discussing Genesis 1-3:4

this post isn't entirely complete, mostly posting this as a proof of concept. 

Recently I’ve been interested in the ideas of quantum state superpositions, and how a particle can be in a “superposition” of 1 and 0 which is essentially saying that the particle is in a “superposition” of both numbers simultaneously.

That thought led me to think of how God, being infinite, is able to know every “superposition” the Universe is in. He knows exactly the different outcomes any given situation will produce. He’s able to guide or what I like to say is “nudge” the timeline of humanity in a way that ultimately leads to His return.

Then I became curious about the creation account in Genesis and re-read it.  
Verses 1:3-4 really stuck out to me.

“And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good and he separated the light from the darkness.” - Genesis 1:3-4

These two verses are nothing short of incredible. There is so much complexity, and emotion that can be drawn from it if you think about what’s actually happening here. This verse describes God laying down the foundations of the Universe, and creating time itself.

When God created the Universe he created it in its entirety. From beginning to end. Now God is infinite in every capacity, He saw every moment that the universe He was about to create would experience.

He saw Humanity’s rise and fall, and it’s struggle to find purpose and meaning amidst the chaos followed by Adam & Eve’s decision to rebel against Him.

He saw every war that would be fought.
He saw the struggle of light against the darkness. 
He heard every prayer that would ever be prayed.
He saw His people crying out to Him for help in their time of need.
He saw every moment, every emotion, thought and experience.
All that characterizes consciousness and humanity’s existence. All from start to finish.

He even saw Jesus dying on a cross for the creation he had yet to create; Humanity.

And even though He perceived all of what would transpire within the bounds of His imminent creation, he uttered the words that would bring it into existence “...Let there be light”. And in those words every string of thought in the vastness of time itself was created.

Even though the existence He was about to create had evil in it, he also saw the good. And it’s because of His love and compassion for humanity that He deemed the universe worthy of existence, and He said it was good. 

To exist speaks to the testament of God’s incalculable love and grace towards mankind, even before the axioms that characterized reality were in place. He thought of us, saw us, empathized with us, and created us so that we may glorify Him. Ephesians 1:4 talks about this.

As a Christian that believes in the absolutism of the Bible, it brings me comfort to know that my future is intimately known by the God that created all things, and that He deemed it worthy of existence, that before He breathed life into reality He saw it all and said it was good.
